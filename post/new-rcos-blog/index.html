  <h1 class="headline" itemprop="headline">Introducing BLOG.RCOS.IO</h1>
  <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Something I&rsquo;m very exciting about happened recently! We finally have an official
RCOS Blog! This is something we&rsquo;ve wanted to get going for a long time, and
finally got around to setting up, thanks to one of our awesome alumni. We have a
lot of valuable knowledge and experience about doing and teaching Open Source,
and I&rsquo;m really happy that we now have an official channel to share it.</p>

<p>It actually looks really clean too, and is cohesive with the rest of our
documentation. I&rsquo;m starting to see why <a href="https://handbook.rcos.io/#/resources/brand_standards">branding
guidelines</a> are so
important. Now if only I had the time to make some for Yacs&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote a post kicking off our Summer Session, and I plan on making more
posts there over the coming months as a part of my knowledge dumping efforts.
I&rsquo;ll probably do a few cross posts between the RCOS blog and my personal blog,
or post modified versions of posts designated for one to the other.</p>

<p>So go check out <a href="https://blog.rcos.io/">the blog</a> and <a href="https://blog.rcos.io/2018/summer-of-rcos/">my recent
post</a>!</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Ada</p>
