      <description>Hello, World!
Intro This is the start of a blog post series and life experiment I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while called &amp;lsquo;Scrum! For Your Life&amp;rsquo;. Put simply, the aim of this series is to explore whether agile methodolgies for software development can be effectively applied to personal organization, and life in general. In practice, this will include some software development tasks, but that is only because I spend way too much of my free time in front of my computer or thinking about software.</description>

      <description>Hello, World!
I&amp;rsquo;m Ada, and this is my blog!
A little about me: I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer, teacher, maker, tinkerer, open source evangelist, and lots of other things! I&amp;rsquo;m currently a senior coordinator at RCOS, the Rensselaer Center for Open Source, which is where I spend most of my time. I love teaching and learning from my peers, developing curriculum, giving talks, and maintaining my open source project, Yacs. I&amp;rsquo;m also involved with MOSSN, the Mozilla Open Source Student Network, where I work with and advise other campus clubs from around the country!</description>
