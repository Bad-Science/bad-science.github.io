      <description>Hello, World!
I&amp;rsquo;m Ada, and this is my blog!
A little about me: I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer, teacher, maker, tinkerer, open source evangelist, and lots of other things! I&amp;rsquo;m currently a senior coordinator at RCOS, the Rensselaer Center for Open Source, which is where I spend most of my time. I love teaching and learning from my peers, developing curriculum, giving talks, and maintaining my open source project, Yacs. I&amp;rsquo;m also involved with MOSSN, the Mozilla Open Source Student Network, where I work with and advise other campus clubs from around the country!</description>
