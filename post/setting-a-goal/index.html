  <h1 class="headline" itemprop="headline">Setting a Goal</h1>
  <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It&rsquo;s been three weeks since I graduated from RPI. I&rsquo;ve had some time to relax and collect myself, which was something I really needed and has definitely been good for my mental health.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ve come to find that I get anxious very quickly if I don&rsquo;t feel like I am accomplishing something! So I really want to use this time to learn how to maximize my productivity, and in turn maximize my general happiness.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve been putting a lot of thought into what I want to achieve over the next few years, what is really important to me, and how I want to spend my time. I&rsquo;ve also been thinking a lot about how I could have done better in school, and how I can do better in the future in whatever I set out to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been expirimenting with some different goal setting and tracking methods, which I will be writing about in an upcoming series of posts. But starting right now, I&rsquo;m setting a slightly simpler goal. To fill this graph:</p>

<p><img src="/static/post/setting-a-goal/graph-june-2018.png" alt="Contributions June 2018" /></p>

<p>This something I&rsquo;ve really wanted to do for a long time. And not just for vanity or to impress people who pass by my GitHub profile. This is part of a larger effort to become a more active open source contributor, and someday be a prominent member of the community. Filling up the graph is simply a concrete, measurable way to help me stay on track.</p>

<p>So by June 1st, 2019, my goal is to have my contributions graph entirely full, with, let&rsquo;s say 1000 total contributions. Wish me luck!!!</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Ada</p>
