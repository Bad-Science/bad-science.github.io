    It&rsquo;s been three weeks since I graduated from RPI. I&rsquo;ve had some time to relax and collect myself, which was something I really needed and has definitely been good for my mental health.
However, I&rsquo;ve come to find that I get anxious very quickly if I don&rsquo;t feel like I am accomplishing something! So I really want to use this time to learn how to maximize my productivity, and in turn maximize my general happiness.  <a href="/post/setting-a-goal/">Read More...</a>

    Something I&rsquo;m very exciting about happened recently! We finally have an official RCOS Blog! This is something we&rsquo;ve wanted to get going for a long time, and finally got around to setting up, thanks to one of our awesome alumni. We have a lot of valuable knowledge and experience about doing and teaching Open Source, and I&rsquo;m really happy that we now have an official channel to share it.
It actually looks really clean too, and is cohesive with the rest of our documentation.  <a href="/post/new-rcos-blog/">Read More...</a>

    So I&rsquo;m going to be writing a number of catching-up blog posts about RCOS over the next few months, but I&rsquo;d like to start with the present. We just started the RCOS Summer session today, and I&rsquo;m super excited!
First of all, despite having been in RCOS for nearly 4 years, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been able to be present on campus for a Summer session. Generally, the Summer sessions are much lighter than the Fall/Spring sessions (by an order of magnitude), and this Summer is no exception.  <a href="/post/summer-of-rcos-1/">Read More...</a>
